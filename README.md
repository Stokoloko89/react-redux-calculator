React-Redux Calculator

This calculator was created using react and the redux toolkit libraries. The aim was to practice my understanding of react and its core component management system as well as my understanding of the redux statement management system.

I used the redux toolkit to simplify the state management of the application, and to use its ability to write "mutative" immutable update logic. This proved advantageous in writing code in less time.

In addition, I used small amounts of Tailwind css to style the layout of the application, as well as some native react hooks to handle conditional rendering of certain components.
